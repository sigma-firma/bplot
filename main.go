// bplot is used as a visual analysis tool for processing time-series quote
// data such as that used for trading stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies,
// mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), derivatives, cryptocurrencies,
// real estate, etc.
//
// We read data stored in .csv format into a slice of lines, each containing
// quote data for a single day, then parse each line, transforming the
// csv-structured data into go-structured data, that can then be analyzed and
// used to run tests, simulations, or whatever the fuck else you want you
// awesome mother fucker.
//
// The bplot program, in its current state, creates a line graph plotting the
// price of the trade-able asset, one for each day (line of the .csv file),
// which are then intended to be stitched into a 10-second video using ffmpeg.
// One day bplot will have more features.
//
// To work properly, bplot currently expects a .csv file with the following
// column layout:
//
// 	Start,End,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Market Cap
//
// We prefer a video of around ~10 seconds in length and ~60 frames per second.
// This means we need to produce 10*60 == ~600 frames. One frame for each day
// right? Wrong. The number of days of data will change literally every day, so
// we normalize the scale of our time-series to fit within these constraints.
//
// At the time of this comment, we have 5242 days of data (lines) in our .csv
// file. Since we're only creating 600 frames, we want to pick out 600 days,
// equally spaced apart. So we divide 5242 by 600: 5242 / 600 = 8.73666. This
// number contains the devils number, but that's not it's problem, it's problem
// is that it's not a whole number. There are a number of different ways to
// handle this situation, and here, we do it wrong. We should probably round
// the result to its closest whole number, in our case 9, and then at the very
// end (len(unprocessed) < 9) just take the last day.
//
// We could also make the number of lines/days evenly divisible by 600 by just
// skipping a number of lines from the beginning, I doubt anyone would notice.
// Just don't tell the boss what you did.
